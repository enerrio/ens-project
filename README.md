# ENS Project
---

A miniature version of [ENS](https://ens.domains/) that can map a human-readable name
to an Ethereum address. This is a simple implementation of ENS and was built using the
Foundry framework.

This simple implementation is capable of registering a new name, retrieving the address of a registered name,
releasing a name, and getting the size of the registry. All names are stored in a mapping that goes from name
to address.
